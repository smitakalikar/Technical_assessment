UI & API tests using Selenium & Rest assured

I have completed UI test automation using Cucumber, selenium and Java.

HAve created simple TestBase class to load the properties file and initialize selenium webdriver.

For API, I have used rest assured Libraby to automate. As Weather API to get 3 hourly weather didnt work for me (error-{"error":"Your API key does not allow access to this endpoint."}), I could not complete the test.

Due to time constraint, Icould not complete automatiing the CI-CD part, but I have used Jenkins to run te selenium tests after every build. so I am comfortable doing that given some more time.
